Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

An inline element doesn't start on a new line and only takes up as much
width as necessary.  A block element always starts on a new line and
takes up the full width available.

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

It is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
instead of relative to the viewport like fixed.

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?

You could use the min-width property.

4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

block: <div>, <section>, <p>
inline: <span>, <a>, <label>
inline-block: <img>

5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 

THe box model is a box that wraps around every HTML element.
The innermost box is the content, which is inside the padding box, which is
inside the border box, which is inside the margin box.

It is confusing because the width and height properties don't take into account
padding or borders. To fix this, a box-sizing property was introduced. The current
best practice is to use the following CSS:

html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

*, *:before, *:after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}
